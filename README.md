# Julia Function Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in a Julia function where the return value is unexpected when the input falls within a specific range.

The `myfunction` function is designed to return different strings based on the input value `x`.
However, it has a flaw: It returns nothing when the input is between 5 and 10, instead of returning "between 5 and 10".

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code, and the `bugSolution.jl` file provides the corrected code.

## Bug Description

The original function is missing an `else` statement to cover the case where `x` is between 5 and 10.  This results in an implicit return of `nothing`, which isn't expected.

## Bug Solution

The solution adds an `else` statement to explicitly handle the case where `x` is between 5 and 10, ensuring the correct string is returned.
